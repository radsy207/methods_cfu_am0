# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:


"Hello World".include?("Hello")
Defining a Boolean for if the argument ("Hello") is present in the string.
The string includes "Hello" so the output is true
"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")
Defining a Boolean for if the string ends with the argument.
The string does not end with "Hello" so the output is false
"Hello World".end_with?("rld")


12.even?
This method has no arguments and will define if an integer is even using a boolean.
example 
puts 3.even?
output would be false
18.next
This method will take an integer and add +1 or a string and making the last letter of the string the next letter in the alphabet.
