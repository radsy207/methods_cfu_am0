# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I am growing more confident as I work through these practices. My group supports eachother well so we aid eachother in understanding.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
Very condfident.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
What is the limit of a method? What can't a method do?
